### Key Classes
- `AbleChatbot`: Main chatbot logic with intent matching and response generation
- Knowledge base structured as intents with patterns and multiple response options
- Additional keyword mappings for enhanced matching

### Matching Algorithm
The chatbot uses three layers of matching to identify user intent:
1. Direct pattern matching with similarity threshold
2. Expanded keyword matching for broader coverage
3. Topic similarity detection for contextual understanding

### UI Features
- Message bubbles with distinct styling for user and bot messages
- Auto-scrolling chat container
- Suggestion chips that update based on conversation context
- Clean, branded header and input area

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Start interacting with the chatbot by typing questions or clicking suggestion chips

## Customization

### Adding New Topics
To add new topics to the knowledge base, add an object to the `knowledgeBase` array with:
- `intent`: Unique identifier for the topic
- `patterns`: Array of phrases that should trigger this topic
- `responses`: Array of response variations

Example:
```javascript
{
    intent: "new_topic",
    patterns: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "phrase1"],
    responses: [
        "Response variation 1",
        "Response variation 2",
        "Response variation 3"
    ]
}
```

### Adding Keywords
To improve matching for existing topics, add entries to the `additionalKeywords` object:

```javascript
this.additionalKeywords = {
    "existing_intent": ["new keyword", "new phrase"]
}
```

## Future Improvements
- Integration with backend API for more dynamic responses
- User authentication for personalized experiences
- Analytics tracking for conversation insights
- Multi-language support
- Voice interaction capabilities
- Expansion from Key Word to Language Flexibility
